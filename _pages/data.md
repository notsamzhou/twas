Data
------

The genotype data comes from the 1000 Genomes Project and contains information on millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or individual variants of DNA, on chromosome 22. The gene expression data comes from the Geuvadis RNA-sequencing project. Combined, these sources contain genetic data for 421 individuals across five populations: people of Northern and Western European Ancestry from Utah (CEU), Fins (FIN), British (GBR), Toscani (YRI), and Yoruba (YRI). The genome wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for IBD were obtained from the analysis carried out in the paper Finucane 2015 Nature Genetics.
